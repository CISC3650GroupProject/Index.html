                        As a child, I often sat on the floor of my abuela Sara’s workshop while she was busy in the kitchen making delicious meals. Her dressmaker’s workshop was her livelihood, but also my playground. Gathering strips of cloth, searching for interesting buttons, hiding under the worktable and pretending to disappear, the workshop invited me to imagine. The piece evokes echoes from that period and celebrates her craft. It honors the strength and creativity of immigrant women who mend,stitch, and keep their families together with found remnants and threads of memory. My grandmother’s family migrated to Argentina in the early 1900’s escaping violent outburst of antisemitism in Ukraine. My mother in-law, a gifted dressmaker born in Poland, survived Nazi labor camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau by sewing fashionable evening wear for female Nazi guards. Thread spools from her Brooklyn sewing kit form the necklace of this piece.

                        The mannequin is covered by strips of maps from every corner of the planet, but each strip tells only a fragment of a story. Only when assembled together, we discern their purpose and aesthetic quality. The belt depicts a seismographic reading of a major earthquake, a reminder of traumas that bind and contain a fragmented past.

                        Delson was a painter and printmaker whose works reflected her exploration of nature and spiritual moods. Delson described her artistic philosophy this way: "Through painting and graphics I explore images to uncover the dynamic forces behind their appearance: emergence, growth, decay, metamorphosis. I try to capture the process of change in time and space, to crystallize a living moment and convey its vitality." These paintings, completed midway through her career, reflect her unique forms, energy, vibrant color, and light.

                            In 1637, Joris Jansen de Rapelje, the father of the first European baby born in New York, purchased 335 acres of land in Brooklyn. In the late 1800s, part of this land became the Wallabout Market, an enormous wholesale market that sold produce from local farms. The market's buildings were Dutch-style two-story structures with stepped gables.
                            <br><br>
                            The market was demolished during World War II, when the U.S. government needed the land to expand the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

                            Exceedingly imaginative and dramatic, Arruda creates compelling portrayals of all facets of human emotions. His probing of the human soul results in raw psychological portraits, and often violent imagery. Disturbing and dreamlike, this painting appears to be a murder scene but is also intriguing for its ambiguity. Is this about a physical death or psychological death? Where are the hands on the central figure? The split images give a sense of movement and fragmentation, enhancing the unsettling feeling.

                            In Echoing Factors, Booker's use of pattern, texture, and subtle variations in color creates an expressive, abstract sculptural relief. A raw explosion of energy emanates from her clever orchestration of bent, looped, and layered tires creating poetic rhythms of swirling forms. Booker describes her approach to her work as being: "Like a painter having a palette, my palette is the textures of the treads, the fibers from discarded materials, and tires that I use to create varied effects."

                            In Dancing Couple, Kentridge aims to "depict the futile battles against entropy . . . representing bodies aging rather than bodies triumphant." And indeed, his depiction of a middle-aged couple clearly conveys both their age and the age of their relationship. Their age is evident in their thickened bodies and their heavy steps, which have lost the nimbleness of youth. The age of their relationship is conveyed more subtly: the two are so accustomed to each other's bodies that, even though they are nude, they don't seem to notice each other's nakedness. As a result, viewers don't immediately notice it, either.

                            Human suffering and its inevitability has long been a theme in Polishchuk's work. <br>
                            Inspired by Jeremiah's Lament in the Bible, this work has a box-within-a-box motif <br>
                            that echoes the rhythmic and repetitive phrasing of Jeremiah's text. Polishchuk states:<br>
                            "Repetition is similar to the idea of memory, which is essentially an endless repetition <br>
                            of something that once happened . . . all we have in our struggle against time is memory."<br><br>

                            An arresting canvas, this mural-like painting combines 10 to 15 coats of paint with <br>
                            Japanese paper, creating innumerable hues of black and white as well as rich and haunting textures.<br>

                            Two artists, in collaboration, have combined these natural shapes, cones and shells. <br>
                            The interconnections, the twists and turns of these shapes with one another, seem to <br>
                            reflect the very essence of human relationships. The scale and interplay of the shapes <br>
                            are enhanced by the use of paper and textiles, which imbue the painting with a rich, <br>

                            Hirsch was a painter, iluustrator, muralist and teacher. Social commentary was the backbone of Hirsch's art, especially works depicting civic corruption and racial injustice. His works are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and many others. Hirsch was a founding member of Artists Equity created to protect the right of visual artists.

                            A solitary figure holds up a beach towel in a grassy field, under a blazing sun. Nickson intensifies the foreground of this painting with the complimentary colors of green and red, as he purposefully contrasts its vertical and horizontal planes. Subtle details add interest: a blue hue of the sky is repeated in the sunbather’s shadow on the grass, while her taut, muscular body is outlined in darker red on the towel.
                            <br><br>
                            The banal action of Nickson’s sunbather is imbued with mystery, as the artist seeks “a vehicle for the human figure in a very particular environment, as a metaphor for a larger range of human experience.”

                            During the 1940's and early 1950's Russell painted in the Abstract Expressionist style, but he later turned to the figure and the classical world. His work was a major force in the re-emergence of figurative painting in America. Russell has said, "My inspiration has always been a nostalgia for some nonexistent golden age. . . . I have always believed that the reality of art is unique . . . that art is the reality underlying the unreality of the everyday world." Russell taught painting at Brooklyn College from 1947 to 1975.

                            This work, which references no specific subject matter, reflects Baumbach's experimentation with abstraction. His use of bold, dissonant colors evokes a dynamic yet mysterious and ambiguous feeling.

                            The Chinese Communist Movement promoted the traditional art of printmaking, especially the woodcut, as a valuable form of communication that could be cheaply produced, easily distributed, and broadly appealing. In 1974, as part of Mao Zedong's "rustification" program, Bing was sent to work in a small farming community. His experience there is reflected in this woodcut, one of his earliest pieces as a printmaker. The work was considered radical at the time because it depicts a personal view of the countryside without any overt political content.

                            Braque is one the great artists and innovators of the twentieth century. He is especially well known for his invention of Cubism with Picasso. Braque's lifelong interest was the depiction of space and the relationship of objects within it. The art historian John Golding said about Braque's fascination with space, "the birds' trajectories describe and inform it -- the beating of their wings stirs space and renders it tangible." Birds were one of the major themes in Braque's art during the last two decades of his life.

                            Alexander Calder revolutionized sculpture by making movement one of its main components. His moving sculptures were called "mobiles"--a word coined in 1931 by the artist Marcel Duchamp. Later in his career he created giant open and transparent stationary constructions which were named "stabiles." These works challenged the traditional notions of sculpture as a solid and static. Moreover, Calder's inventive abstract forms and innovative use of nontraditional materials, were very influential in changing the art of sculpture. This lithograph is a study for one of Calder's monumental stabiles. These sculptures have have become public landmarks in many cities around the world.
